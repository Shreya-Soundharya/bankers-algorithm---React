What is the Banker's Algorithm?

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for the safety of resource allocation to multiple processes in a computer system. It operates by maintaining a set of resources and tracking the maximum resources each process may need. The algorithm checks whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state, meaning that all processes can complete without entering a deadlock. If the system is in a safe state after the request, the resources are allocated; otherwise, the request is denied.

**Overview**
Upon accessing the application, you will be directed to the Introduction page, where you can explore informative slides about the Banker's Algorithm. Navigation to other sections is facilitated through the hamburger menu located in the top right corner.

The Pseudocode page provides a detailed explanation of how the algorithm operates, while the Calculator page allows users to input custom values to verify the system's state. Please note that the maximum number of processes is capped at 20, and the maximum number of resources is limited to 10.
